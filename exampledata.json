  "shortDescription":"Upper body, lower body, upper body and so on! We will welcome a longer duration between revisiting compound upper and lower body movements due to the formatting. A great way to promote being able to lift slightly heavier per exercise even though technically rest is on the shorter side.\n \nThe timer will be on for supersets with the first exercise being 40 seconds, followed then by the next exercise for 30 seconds. We then have 20 seconds rest in-between each superset! \n \nWe are alternating
  between upper body and lower body supersets so you will have come across this format during the EPIC
  Programs if you have completed some of those! The term is known as Peripheral Heart Action (PHA) and
  there are various ways of incorporating this technique into your training. I usually use it to allow
  for more volume due to alternating so essentially within this workout, we hit chest and triceps for 70
  seconds, but we then have 3 minutes before we hit it again!\n \nI have always had a passion and interest
  for learning and taking research findings into consideration and applying elements into my training and
  daily life. I think that’s why I love variety... as nearly all formats, weights, timings, structure etc
  have a purpose and/or cause an adaptation.  You will likely have experienced many training methods
  spanning the EPIC Programs and other series on this channel.\n \nFor this workout, you will need some
  dumbbells, a mat, a chair or bench for Bulgarian lunges and a yoga block or stepper to elevate the heels
  for heel elevated squats.\n \nOf course, you can perform regular lunges as opposed to Bulgarian lunges or
  high squats as opposed to heel elevated if you prefer! \n \nAdapt this workout to suit you!\n \nSlow and
  steady with cardio even though not necessarily what you might always connect with the concept of
  cardio…there absolutely is cardio elements within lifting weights. \n \nWe will finish with a flow that
  is the Maker, primarily an upper body but involves the entire body that will be combined with high squats
   to truly finish feeling worked but proud!\n \nThe dumbbells I am using for your reference are 2 x 17.5kg
   and 2 x 10kg each.\n \nX2\n \n2 x 17.5kg\nCHEST PRESS\nPUSH UPS\n \nSTATIC LUNGE\nBODYWEIGHT ONLY

   aware that you rotate between upper and lower really will help motivate you to work that bit harder
   knowing that your legs will have a rest as upper body next!\n \nI hope you all have a fantastic session
   and lift the very best you can with intent on every rep!\n \nCx\n\n……………………………………………………………\n\nUseful
